# Linear Insertion Sort

This program performs a Linear Insertion Sort on a file of unsorted integers.
The user is asked to enter the name of a file (which contains data) so that the program
can perform a linear insertion sort on the data, put it in correct order (least to greatest), and output it.

Once all the numbers from a particular file are read in and sorted, the resulting sorted values will be outputted,
and the user will be asked to input a file name again.

If the user enters an asterisk (*) as the first character when inputting the file name,
then the program terminates
