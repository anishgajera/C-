# Linked List Cross-Reference (C++)

This program is designed to take in a file consisting of lines of text and seperate each line into its individual words and display them
along with displaying the line number they appear on using a linked list.

A linked list is used to go through the text file the user enters the name of, and the words are seperated. During seperation,
repeated words are accounted for and are disregarded. Then, the words are plaed in alphabetical order (inserted as program runs via a linear linked list method).

As the program runs, it outputs the words, inserting based on alphabetical order as the program continues to run, and lists the line number(s) the word
may appear on in the file (multiple if the word is repeated throughout the file.
