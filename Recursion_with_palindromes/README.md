# Palindrome Recursion

This program is designed to take in an input string from the user. The user is asked to
input the string of their choice. If the user enters an asterisk, the program exits.

Once the user inputs the string of their choice, the program takes the string
and through the use of functions and recursion, figures out whether the string
is a palindrome. If it is, the function returns true(is a Palindrome), else, false(is not a Palindrome)
