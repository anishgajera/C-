# Number Grid
This program reads in up to 100 positive non-zero integers that are inputted through the keyboard.
The user types in the values into the keyboard and terminates their input by entering a zero at the end.
(i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 0; the 0 signals the computer to stop input)

After inputting the numbers, the numbers are sent into an array, and then the values of that array
are allocated to 2d matricies. One of the matricies becomes a sum grid and the other, a product grid.
For the matricies, the values entered by the users go across the top and down the left side
 
At the end, the 2 matricies are displayed and the frequency of unique numbers (sums/products) is also displayed.
The program then returns and asks the user to enter in values again. At this point, if the user enters a 0 for 
the first value, the program exits.
